it must have been the js file.  once i updated it the objects were back.  but they are back with the spacing issues.  here is what i want from the game 2 screen:  The left container and right container to be large and take up half the screen and to not shift around during gameplay.  The 32 boxes inside each container to be evenly spread out (not wasting excess room within their respective containers) and to stay the same size throughout game play.  The font for the Presidents to fit within the boxes (using a variety of methods: smaller font, use 2 rows, abbreviate first name to initial).  When all the boxes are full on the right, i want a test button to appear in the left side container (which would then be empty until the button appears).  when the TEST button is pressed, the test button itself can go away until triggered again, and then also hitting the TEST button will check the position of all the presidents in the right side to see if they are in the correct position.  if they are in the correct position, i want them to turn green.  if they are not in the correct position i want them to turn red, and then return to the left side container so that the player can place them again.  if all the elements are correct, then show the win screen.  The win screen will be similar to the win screen in game1.  it will say "Congratulations!  You Win!  Accuracy:  nn% Most missed: name of president, # of president, dates of president".  In order to produce the accuracy nn and the most missed presidents we will have to keep track of how many misses the player made, and which presidents they missed and how many times they missed each president.  then we should be able to calculate their accuracy and display those things in the win screen.  The win screen should also have a button for returning to the main menu.  and a button to play the game again.
